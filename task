1. Write a program that prints "Hello, My name is [Your Name]"

Solution: 1
print("Bio Printer")
Greetings=input("Hello , " )
Name=input("My name is : ")                                  
print("BIO Printer"+ Greetings + " + " + Name , " ")

O/p:
Bio Printer
Hello , 
My name is : Grandhi Lakshmi Navyatha.
                Or 
Solution2: 
				
name = input("Hello ," " " "My name is ")
print(name) 
O/p:Hello , My name is Grandhi Lakshmi Navyatha
 
2.Create a program that takes two numbers as input and performs
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Handle
potential errors like division by zero.

Solution:

calculator =  input("What Operation you would like to Perform  (Add/Sub/Multiply/Division) ?")
numbers1 = int(input("Enter 1st Number:" ))
numbers2 = int(input("Enter 2nd Number:"))

if  calculator == "Add":
    print("Addition of " + str(numbers1) + " and " + str(numbers2) + " = " ,  numbers1  + numbers2   )
elif calculator == "Sub" :
    print("subtraction of " + str(numbers1) + " and " + str(numbers2) + " = " ,  numbers1 - numbers2)
elif calculator == "Multiply":
    print("multipy of " + str(numbers1) + " and " + str(numbers2) + " = " ,  numbers1 * numbers2)
elif calculator == "Division":
    if numbers2 == 0:
        print ("You cannot divide a number by 0, Retry with correct Numbers")
    else:
        print("Division of " + str(numbers1) + " and " + str(numbers2) + " = " ,  numbers1 / numbers2)
else:
    print("check the inputs once u typed invalid ")
O/p:
o/p:
What Operation you would like to Perform  (Add/Sub/Multiply/Division) ?Division
Enter 1st Number:6
Enter 2nd Number:2
Division of 6 and 2 =  3.0


3. Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its
length and width, both provided by the user.


Solution:

length = int(input("Enter ur length of the rectangle :"))
breadth=int(input("Enter ur length of the rectangle :"))
area = length * breadth
print("The area of the rectangle is: " ,area)

O/p:
Enter ur length of the rectangle :23
Enter ur length of the rectangle :50
The area of the rectangle is:  1150

4. Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints whether
it's even or odd.

Solution:

num = int(input("Enter ur number to test whether it is Even or Odd: "))
if (num % 2)==0:
    print("It is an Even number.")
else:
    print("It is an Odd number.")
	
O/p:
Enter ur number to test whether it is Even or Odd: 7
It is an Odd number.

Enter ur number to test whether it is Even or Odd: 6
It is an Even number.
