1. Write a program that takes a string as input from the user and prints
the same string in both uppercase and lowercase. 

solution:
Name = input("What is ur favorite language? ")
print("My favorite language is : ",Name.lower())
print("My favorite language is : ",Name.upper())

O/p:

What is ur favorite language? python
My favorite language is :  python
My favorite language is :  PYTHON

2. Write a program that takes a sentence as input and splits it into a
list of words using the split() method. Then, print each word on a new
line. 

Solution 1:

Bio = input("My name is Grandhi Lakshmi Navyatha,\nI recently completed my Bachelor's at ISTS Womens engineering college,\nMy hobbies are Learning new things and Explore.")
print(split(Bio))

O/p:

My name is Grandhi Lakshmi Navyatha,
I recently completed my Bachelor's at ISTS Womens engineering college,
My hobbies are Learning new things and Explore.
                    Or
	
Solution 2:

sentence=input("Enter a sentence: ")
for item in sentence.split(" "):
    print(item)
O/p:
Enter a sentence: My name is Grandhi Lakshmi Navyatha
My
name
is
Grandhi
Lakshmi
Navyatha

3. Write a program that takes a string as input and prints the reversed
string (without using slicing). 

Solution 1:

name = "navyatha"[::-1]
print(name)

O/p:
ahtayvan
              or
 Solution 2:		
 name = "navyatha"
 rev = ''.join(reversed(name)) 
 print(rev)
 O/p:
 ahtayvan
		
4. Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads
the same forwards and backward, ignoring case and nonalphanumeric characters)

Solution 1:
def isPalindrome(name):
    return name==name [::-1]
name= "mom"
result = isPalindrome(name)
if result:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")

O/p:
Yes

Solution 2:


def isPalindrome(name):
    return name==name[::-1]
name = "navyatha"
result = isPalindrome(name)
if result:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")

O/p:
no
