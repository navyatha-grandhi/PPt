                                               ** For Loop **
								
1. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop. 

Solution:

numbers = 0
for numbers in range(1,11):
    print(numbers)
	
O/p:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

2. Write a program that checks if a given number is a prime number. 

Solution:

num = 7
if num > 1:
    for i in range(2, (num//2)+1):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number")
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number")
		
O/p:

7 is a prime number

3. Write a program to create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to n.

Solution:

N = 6
squares_list = [i*i for i in range(1, N+1)]
sum_of_squares = sum(squares_list)
print("Sum of squares of first", N, "natural numbers is", sum_of_squares)

O/p:

Sum of squares of first 6 natural numbers is 91

4. Write a program to print the following pattern:
*
**
***
****
*****

Solution:

rows = 5
for i in range(1,rows+1):
    for j in range(1,i+1):
        print("*",end="")
    print()
	
O/p:

*
**
***
****
*****

                                            ** While Loop**
										
1. Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n (user input)
using a while loop. 

Solution:

def sum_of_natural_numbers(N):
    total = 0
    count = 1
    while count <= N:
        total += count
        count += 1

    return total

N = 2

result = sum_of_natural_numbers(N)

print("The Sum of the First", N, "Natural Numbers is:", result)
	
O/p:

The Sum of the First 2 Natural Numbers is: 3

2. Print all even numbers between 1 and 20 using a while loop. 

Solution:

num =int(input("Enter ur number: "))
i = 2
while(num >= i):
    print(i)
    i=i+2
O/p:

Enter ur number: 20
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
16
18
20

3. Create a number-guessing game where the program picks a random number,
and the user keeps guessing until they get it right. Provide feedback if the guess
is too high or low. 

Solution:

import random
c_guess = random.randint(1,4)
u_guess = int(input("Enter a guess: "))
while u_guess != c_guess:
    if u_guess < c_guess:
        print("too low.")
        u_guess = int(input("Enter a guess again: "))
    elif u_guess > c_guess:
        print("too high.")
    
    else:
        break
        print("u guessed it right")
    if u_guess == c_guess:
        print("congratzzzzz")
    else:
        print("sorryyy")
		
O/p:

Enter a guess: 1
too low.
Enter a guess again: 1
sorryyy
too low.
Enter a guess again: 4
congratzzzzz

4. Write a program to check if a number is a palindrome using a while loop.

Solution:

i = int(input("Enter number: "))
rev = 0
x = i
while(i>0):
    rev= (rev*10)+i%10
    i=i//10
if(x==rev):
    print("x is palindrome.")
else:
    print(" x is not palindrome.")
	
O/p:

Enter number: 232
x is palindrome.
